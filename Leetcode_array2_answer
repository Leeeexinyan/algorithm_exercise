//There're two ways to solve this problem. 
//All the codes are written in C Language. 

//The first answer was copied directly from an online sourec. 
//I just changed some variable names. 

int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int* nums, int numsSize){
    
    int max_1s = 0;
    int con_1s = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++){
    	if (nums[i] == 0) 
            con_1s = 0;
        else{
             con_1s++;
             max_1s = fmax(max_1s, con_1s);
        } 
    }
    return max_1s;
}

//The second answer was inspired by the first one, but changed by myself. 
//There's one thing to be  noticed, con_1s should be innitialized in else statement. 
//Or the previous result will be added to the con_1s if the next number is not 1. 

//And I take the comparison out of the else statement.
